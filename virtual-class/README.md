# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-classroom.git
   cd virtual-classroom
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/virtualclassroom
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend server and the React development server.

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Code Walkthrough

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

1. `server/server.js`: This is the entry point for our backend. It sets up the Express app, connects to MongoDB, and includes our routes.

2. `server/models/`: Contains Mongoose schemas for our data models (User, Class, Unit, Session, Discussion).

3. `server/routes/`: Defines API endpoints for different resources.

4. `server/controllers/`: Implements the logic for our API endpoints.

5. `server/middleware/auth.js`: Implements JWT authentication middleware.

### Frontend (React)

1. `client/src/App.js`: The main component that sets up routing and global state.

2. `client/src/components/`: Reusable React components like Sidebar, ClassCard, etc.

3. `client/src/pages/`: Components for different pages/routes in our app.

4. `client/src/context/`: React context for global state management.

5. `client/src/services/api.js`: Functions for making API calls to our backend.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API_DOCS.md](API_DOCS.md) file.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```
npm test
```

This will run both backend and frontend tests.

## Deployment

1. Build the React frontend:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

2. Set environment variables for production.

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

For detailed deployment instructions, including how to deploy to platforms like Heroku or AWS, please refer to the [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) file.
